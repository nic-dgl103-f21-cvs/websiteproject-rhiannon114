          <p> At the end October we had a small Halloweeen party. The were encoraged to come out in their costumes and took part of a number of <i>spokey</i> activities. One of the favourite activities of the night was the pinata filled with candy that was gracously donated by CI Lynxleg for all to enjoy. Our Corp Halloweeen party has started to become a bit of a tradition that we hope will continue on in the up comeing years.</p>
